Wildlife Camera Trap CNN Image Classifier

In this project I explore a dataset from the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park with wildlie camera trap images. I create image classification models using CNNs, perform hyperparameter tuning and use accuracy as a performance metric for comparison.

This repository is for the final project of DTSA511- Introduction to Deep Learning
